**AWS**
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of on-demand services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, and developer tools.
* AWS organizations can quickly scale their infrastructure, reduce costs, and increase agility by accessing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.
* By offering a secure and reliable cloud infrastructure, AWS allows businesses to focus on their core activities, innovation, and growth, without being bogged down by the complexities and costs of managing hardware or infrastructure.

**Public Cloud**
* Accessibility: Public cloud services are accessible to anyone over the internet. Users can access resources on-demand from anywhere with an internet connection.
* Shared Infrastructure: Resources in a public cloud environment are shared among multiple users and organizations, leading to cost savings through economies of scale.
* Scalability: Public cloud services offer elastic scalability, allowing users to rapidly scale resources up or down based on demand.
* Managed by Third-party: Public cloud infrastructure is owned, managed, and maintained by third-party cloud service providers, relieving users of the burden of hardware management and maintenance tasks.
* Pay-as-you-go Pricing: Public cloud services typically operate on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where users only pay for the resources they consume, providing cost-efficiency and flexibility
